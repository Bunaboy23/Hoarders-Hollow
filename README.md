# Hoarders-Hollow
 A cozy 2D pixel-art farming simulation game set in a forgotten valley with rich lore, branching storylines, and a 30-day time limit to save your family’s land. Grow crops, raise animals, explore the village, and restore your grandfather’s legacy before the bank takes it all away.
